## :closed_lock_with_key: Authentication

Authentication is done via API keys. Sign up at https://developers.messagemedia.com/register/ to get your API keys. Username is the key and password is the secret.

Requests are authenticated using HTTP Basic Auth or HMAC. Provide your API key as the auth_user_name and API secret as the auth_password.

If you set an HMAC username and password the controller will use HMAC authentication. Otherwise it will assume basic auth. The file to input these credentials into is the Configuration.cs file you will find in the main directory of the solution. 

## :interrobang: Errors

Our API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. For errors, we will also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as JSON. The most common status codes are listed below.

#### HTTP Status Codes

| Code      | Title       | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid Request | The request was invalid |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Your API credentials are invalid |
| 403 | Disabled feature | Feature not enabled |
| 404 | Not Found |	The resource does not exist |
| 50X | Internal Server Error | An error occurred with our API |

## :star: Installation
The code provided uses the Newtonsoft Json.NET NuGet Package. If the automatic NuGet package restore
is enabled, these dependencies will be installed automatically. Therefore,
you will need internet access for build.

"This library requires Visual Studio 2017 for compilation."
1. Open the solution (MessageMediaMessages.sln) file.
2. Invoke the build process using `Ctrl+Shift+B` shortcut key or using the `Build` menu as shown below.

![Building SDK using Visual Studio](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=buildSDK&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

## How to Use

The build process generates a portable class library, which can be used like a normal class library. The generated library is compatible with Windows Forms, Windows RT, Windows Phone 8,
Silverlight 5, Xamarin iOS, Xamarin Android and Mono. More information on how to use can be found at the [MSDN Portable Class Libraries documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/gg597391%28v=vs.100%29.aspx).

The following section explains how to use the MessageMediaMessages library in a new console project.

### 1. Starting a new project

For starting a new project, right click on the current solution from the *solution explorer* and choose  ``` Add -> New Project ```.

![Add a new project in the existing solution using Visual Studio](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=addProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

Next, choose "Console Application", provide a ``` TestConsoleProject ``` as the project name and click ``` OK ```.

![Create a new console project using Visual Studio](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=createProject&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

### 2. Set as startup project

The new console project is the entry point for the eventual execution. This requires us to set the ``` TestConsoleProject ``` as the start-up project. To do this, right-click on the  ``` TestConsoleProject ``` and choose  ``` Set as StartUp Project ``` form the context menu.

![Set the new cosole project as the start up project](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=setStartup&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

### 3. Add reference of the library project

In order to use the MessageMediaMessages library in the new project, first we must add a projet reference to the ``` TestConsoleProject ```. First, right click on the ``` References ``` node in the *solution explorer* and click ``` Add Reference... ```.

![Open references of the TestConsoleProject](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=addReference&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

Next, a window will be displayed where we must set the ``` checkbox ``` on ``` MessageMediaMessages.Standard ``` and click ``` OK ```. By doing this, we have added a reference of the ```MessageMediaMessages.Standard``` project into the new ``` TestConsoleProject ```.

![Add a reference to the TestConsoleProject](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=createReference&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

### 4. Write sample code

Once the ``` TestConsoleProject ``` is created, a file named ``` Program.cs ``` will be visible in the *solution explorer* with an empty ``` Main ``` method. This is the entry point for the execution of the entire solution.
Here, you can add code to initialize the client library and acquire the instance of a *Controller* class. Sample code to initialize the client library and using controller methods is given in the subsequent sections.

![Add a reference to the TestConsoleProject](https://apidocs.io/illustration/cs?step=addCode&workspaceFolder=MessageMediaMessages-CSharp&workspaceName=MessageMediaMessages&projectName=MessageMediaMessages.Standard)

## Initialization

### <a name="send_messages"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png "MessageMedia.Messages.Controllers.MessagesController.SendMessages") SendMessages

> Submit one or more (up to 100 per request) SMS, MMS or text to voice messages for delivery.
> The most basic message has the following structure:
> ```json
> {
>     "messages": [
>         {
>             "content": "My first message!",
>             "destination_number": "+61491570156"
>         }
>     ]
> }
> ```
> More advanced delivery features can be specified by setting the following properties in a message:
> - ```callback_url``` A URL can be included with each message to which Webhooks will be pushed to
>   via a HTTP POST request. Webhooks will be sent if and when the status of the message changes as
>   it is processed (if the delivery report property of the request is set to ```true```) and when replies
>   are received. Specifying a callback URL is optional.
> - ```content``` The content of the message. This can be a Unicode string, up to 5,000 characters long.
>   Message content is required.
> - ```delivery_report``` Delivery reports can be requested with each message. If delivery reports are requested, a webhook
>   will be submitted to the ```callback_url``` property specified for the message (or to the webhooks)
>   specified for the account every time the status of the message changes as it is processed. The
>   current status of the message can also be retrieved via the Delivery Reports endpoint of the
>   Messages API. Delivery reports are optional and by default will not be requested.
> - ```destination_number``` The destination number the message should be delivered to. This should be specified in E.164
>   international format. For information on E.164, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
>   A destination number is required.
> - ```format``` The format specifies which format the message will be sent as, ```SMS``` (text message), ```MMS``` (multimedia message)
>   or ```TTS``` (text to speech). With ```TTS``` format, we will call the destination number and read out the
>   message using a computer generated voice. Specifying a format is optional, by default ```SMS``` will be used.
> - ```source_number``` A source number may be specified for the message, this will be the number that
>   the message appears from on the handset. By default this feature is _not_ available and will be ignored
>   in the request. Please contact <support@messagemedia.com> for more information. Specifying a source
>   number is optional and a by default a source number will be assigned to the message.
> - ```media``` The media is used to specify the url of the media file that you are trying to send. Supported file formats include png, jpeg and gif. ```format``` parameter must be set to ```MMS``` for this to work.
> - ```subject``` The subject field is used to denote subject of the MMS message and has a maximum size of 64 characters long. Specifying a subject is optional.
> - ```source_number_type``` If a source number is specified, the type of source number may also be
>   specified. This is recommended when using a source address type that is not an internationally
>   formatted number, available options are ```INTERNATIONAL```, ```ALPHANUMERIC``` or ```SHORTCODE```. Specifying a
>   source number type is only valid when the ```source_number``` parameter is specified and is optional.
>   If a source number is specified and no source number type is specified, the source number type will be
>   inferred from the source number, however this may be inaccurate.
> - ```scheduled``` A message can be scheduled for delivery in the future by setting the scheduled property.
>   The scheduled property expects a date time specified in ISO 8601 format. The scheduled time must be
>   provided in UTC and is optional. If no scheduled property is set, the message will be delivered immediately.
> - ```message_expiry_timestamp``` A message expiry timestamp can be provided to specify the latest time
>   at which the message should be delivered. If the message cannot be delivered before the specified
>   message expiry timestamp elapses, the message will be discarded. Specifying a message expiry
>   timestamp is optional.
> - ```metadata``` Metadata can be included with the message which will then be included with any delivery
>   reports or replies matched to the message. This can be used to create powerful two-way messaging
>   applications without having to store persistent data in the application. Up to 10 key / value metadata data
>   pairs can be specified in a message. Each key can be up to 100 characters long, and each value up to
>   256 characters long. Specifying metadata for a message is optional.
> The response body of a successful POST request to the messages endpoint will include a ```messages```
> property which contains a list of all messages submitted. The list of messages submitted will
> reflect the list of messages included in the request, but each message will also contain two new
> properties, ```message_id``` and ```status```. The returned message ID will be a 36 character UUID
> which can be used to check the status of the message via the Get Message Status endpoint. The status
> of the message which reflect the status of the message at submission time which will always be
> ```queued```. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for more information on message
> statues.
> *Note: when sending multiple messages in a request, all messages must be valid for the request to be successful.
> If any messages in the request are invalid, no messages will be sent.*

> Each reply will contain details about the reply message, as well as details of the message the reply was sent
> in response to, including any metadata specified. Every reply will have a reply ID to be used with the
> confirm replies endpoint.
> *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a reply are the inverse of those
> specified in the message the reply is in response to. The source number of the reply message is the
> same as the destination number of the original message, and the destination number of the reply
> message is the same as the source number of the original message. If a source number
> wasn't specified in the original message, then the destination number property will not be present
> in the reply message.*
> Subsequent requests to the check replies endpoint will return the same reply messages and a maximum
> of 100 replies will be returned in each request. Applications should use the confirm replies endpoint
> in the following pattern so that replies that have been processed are no longer returned in
> subsequent check replies requests.
> 1. Call check replies endpoint
> 2. Process each reply message
> 3. Confirm all processed reply messages using the confirm replies endpoint
> *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than polling
> the check replies endpoint.*


```csharp
Task<Models.CheckRepliesResponse> CheckReplies()
```

#### Example Usage

```csharp

Models.CheckRepliesResponse result = await replies.CheckReplies();

```


### <a name="confirm_replies_as_received"></a>![Method: ](https://apidocs.io/img/method.png "MessageMedia.Messages.Controllers.RepliesController.ConfirmRepliesAsReceived") ConfirmRepliesAsReceived

> Mark a reply message as confirmed so it is no longer returned in check replies requests.
> The confirm replies endpoint is intended to be used in conjunction with the check replies endpoint
> to allow for robust processing of reply messages. Once one or more reply messages have been processed
> they can then be confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint so they are no longer returned in
> subsequent check replies requests.
> The confirm replies endpoint takes a list of reply IDs as follows:
> ```json
> {
>     "reply_ids": [
>         "011dcead-6988-4ad6-a1c7-6b6c68ea628d",
>         "3487b3fa-6586-4979-a233-2d1b095c7718",
>         "ba28e94b-c83d-4759-98e7-ff9c7edb87a1"
>     ]
> }
> ```
> Up to 100 replies can be confirmed in a single confirm replies request.
